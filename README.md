# Vue Chatroom

This project is a Vue.js-based chatroom. I recently created another chatroom using Vue.js, PHP and MySQL. This particular project utilizes Vue.js, Socket.io, Node.js, Express, Bootstrap Vue and SASS as the main technologies.

It's not necessarily the prettiest application that I have developed. But, the main purpose here was to get more experience with other libraries like socket.io and express. That's why Bootstrap Vue and SASS were used, to shorten development time.
